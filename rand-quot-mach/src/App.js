          The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how
          things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the
          broadest possible sense of the term.

          It is clear from the above analysis, therefore, that classical

          C. The ability to know facts of the form <em>x is Î¦</em> is acquired.

          A and B together entail not-C; B and C entail not-A; A and C entail

          Thus the conceptual framework of persons is not something that needs
          to be <em>reconciled with</em> the scientific image, but rather
          something to be <em>joined</em> to it. Thus, to complete the
          scientific image we need to enrich it <em>not</em> with more ways of
          saying what is the case, but with the language of community and
          individual intentions.

          The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and
          reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent
          of the vagaries of me and you. Thus, the very origin of the conception
          of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion

          increase of knowledge.
