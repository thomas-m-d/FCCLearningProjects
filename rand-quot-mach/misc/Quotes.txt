The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term.
--Wilfrid Sellars

...these linguistic objects are subject to rules and principles--[they] are fraught with 'ought'...
--Wilfrid Sellars

It is clear from the above analysis, therefore, that classical sense-datum theories ... are confronted by an inconsistent triad made up of the following three propositions:
A. X senses red sense content s entails x non-inferentially knows that s is red.
B. The ability to sense sense contents is unacquired.
C. The ability to know facts of the form <em>x is Î¦</em> is acquired.
A and B together entail not-C; B and C entail not-A; A and C entail not-B.
--Wilfrid Sellars

Thus the conceptual framework of persons is not something that needs to be <em>reconciled with</em> the scientific image, but rather something to be <em>joined</em> to it. Thus, to complete the scientific image we need to enrich it <em>not</em> with more ways of saying what is the case, but with the language of community and individual intentions.
--Wilfrid Sellars

Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.
--Immanuel Kant

All the interests of my reason, speculative as well as practical, combine in the three following questions: 1. What can I know? 2. What ought I to do? 3. What may I hope?
--Immanuel Kant
(who later added a fourth question, "4. What is the human?")

So act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.
--Immanuel Kant

We have no power of Introspection, but all knowledge of the internal world is derived by hypothetical reasoning from our knowledge of external facts.
--Charles Sanders Peirce

We have no power of Intuition, but every cognition is determined logically by previous cognitions.
--Charles Sanders Peirce

We have no power of thinking without signs.
--Charles Sanders Peirce

We have no conception of the absolutely incognizable.
--Charles Sanders Peirce

The real, then, is that which, sooner or later, information and reasoning would finally result in, and which is therefore independent of the vagaries of me and you. Thus, the very origin of the conception of reality shows that this conception essentially involves the notion of a COMMUNITY, without definite limits, and capable of an indefinite increase of knowledge.
--Charles Sanders Peirce

...the word or sign which man [sic] uses <em>is</em> the man himself [sic].... Thus my language is the sum total of myself; for the man [sic] is the thought.
--Charles Sanders Peirce

What can be said at all can be said clearly
--Ludwig Wittgenstein

Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.
--Ludwig Wittgenstein

I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems [of philosophy] have in essentials been finally solved. And if I am not mistaken in this, then the value of this work ... consists in the fact that it shows how little has been done when these problems have been solved.
--Ludwig Wittgenstein

"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?" -- What is true or false is what human beings <em>say</em>; and it is in their <em>language</em> that human beings agree. This is agreement not in opinions, but rather in form of life.
--Ludwig Wittgenstein

In what sense are my sensations <em>private</em>? -- Well, only I can know whether I am really in pain; another person can only surmise it. -- In one way this is false, and in another nonsense.
--Ludwig Wittgenstein

So in the end when one is doing philosophy one gets to the point where one would like just to emit an inarticulate sound.
--Ludwig Wittgenstein

My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)
--Ludwig Wittgenstein
