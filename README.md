# FCCLearningProjects
Each folder contains the source code for a separate FreeCodeCamp project that passes the
FreeCodeCamp tests for that project but has not been polished. This projects were completed
with an eye towards learning the basic concepts I was learning at the time, but **do not
represent my full abilities** at the time I was coding them.
